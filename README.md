# Homework 2 - Portfolio Website
Build a portfolio from scratch

[Live GitHub Portfolio](https://matildabrantley.github.io/portfolio/)

## Goals for Portfolio Homework

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
* WHEN I load their portfolio
    * THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    * THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    * THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    * THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    * THEN I am taken to that deployed application
* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    * THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Challenging Aspects of Project
* Positioning all the elements to match the mock-up was difficult.
* Maintaining relative positions when window is rescaled proved difficult.
* Felt like I needed to create divs too often.
* Re-using card classes in most recent project card (due to larger display)

## Reworks
* Incorporated many elements into reusable classes, such as major-section, section-title, card-title
* Switched to CSS Grid to quickly rearrange major elements when needed
